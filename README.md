# Assumption

I assume that you have maven installed and properly setup and can be run through command line.

# How to Install and Run it

## 1. Running through terminal
Clone the project or download zip file (unzip after downloading). Open git bash (or any other command line terminal that can run maven command) and go to the project root
directory. Run the following command:
 
 **mvn spring-boot:run**
 
## 2. Running through IDE (Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA)
Import the project in your IDE as maven project and run it as you would run a normal console java application.


# Explanation
In terms of technology I have used Spring Boot, Hibernate, H2 as in memory database and Thymeleaf as view technology instead of JSP.
Thymeleaf is very powerful natural template technology.
